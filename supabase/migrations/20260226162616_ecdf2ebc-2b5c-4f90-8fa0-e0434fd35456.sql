-- Fix profile/avatar upload permissions
-- 1) Harden profiles RLS policies for authenticated users
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles;
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile"

FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 2) Add storage policies for avatars bucket (owner folder pattern: {user_id}/...)
